# Glossary Part 1

**Abstract class** - An abstract class is a type of class that is not allowed to be instantiated.  The only reason it exists is to be extended.  Abstract classes contain methods and variables common to all the subclasses, but the abstract class itself is of a type that will not be used directly.  Even a single abstract method requires that a class be marked __abstract__.
