# Glossary Part 2 - C

**Call Stack** - A list of methods that have been called in the order in which they were called.  Typically, the most recently called method (the current method) is thought of as being at the top of the call stack.


**Casting** - Casting is the conversion of one type of one type to another type.  Typically, casting is used to convert an object reference to either a subtype (for example casting an Animal reference to a Horse), but casting can also be used on primitive types to convert to a larger type to a smaller type, such as from a long to an int.


**char** - A 16-bit unsigned primitive data type that holds a single Unicode character.


**Character literals** - represented by a single character in single quotes such as 'A'.


**Child class** -  _see Derived class_


**Class** - definition of a type.  It's the blueprint used to construct objects of that type.


**Class members** - things that belong to a class including methods (static and non static), variable (static and non static), nested classes (static and non static).  Class members can have any of the four access control levels (public, protected, default(package) and private).


**Class methods** - often referred to as a static method, may be accessed directly from a class without instantiating the class first.


**Class variable** - _See static variable_


**Collection** - An object used to store other objects. Collections are also commonly referred to as containers.  Two common examples of collections are HashMap and ArrayList.
