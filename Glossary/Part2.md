# Glossary Part 2 - C

**Call Stack** - A list of methods that have been called in the order in which they were called.  Typically, the most recently called method (the current method) is thought of as being at the top of the call stack.


**Casting** - Casting is the conversion of one type of one type to another type.  Typically, casting is used to convert an object reference to either a subtype (for example casting an Animal reference to a Horse), but casting can also be used on primitive types to convert to a larger type to a smaller type, such as from a long to an int.
